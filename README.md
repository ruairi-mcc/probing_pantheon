# probing_pantheon
This is the code I used to complete the data analysis for my Masters Thesis. 

This project utilised the <a href="https://github.com/PantheonPlusSH0ES/DataRelease)https://github.com/PantheonPlusSH0ES/DataRelease">Pantheon+ Data Release, </a> to examine the evoltion of cosmological parameters with redshift as well as angular peculiarites relating to the Hubble constant. 

The code for the angular data analysis can be found <a href="https://github.com/ruairi-mcc/probing_pantheon/blob/main/pantheon%2B_angles_final.ipynb">here.</a> 

The abstract is included below:</br>

<i>"The value of the Hubble constant 𝐻<sub>0</sub>, obtained using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) method and type Ia supernova (SnIa) distance ladder method do not agree with each other. The former favouring a 𝐻<sub>0</sub> of around 67 km/s/Mpc and the latter favouring a value of about 73 km/s/Mpc, making them discrepant to approximately five standard deviations (5𝜎). The Hubble tension has persisted for over a decade and has become one of the most significant challenges to the standard model of cosmology. In this study we analyse data from the Pantheon+ sample and build on previous research to present evidence that the redshift evolution of flat ΛCDM cosmological parameters 𝐻<sub>0</sub> and Ω𝑚, persists in the latest Pantheon+ sample. We also present evidence of anisotropies in the Hubble constant and in the distance ladder in the direction of the CMB dipole. These findings hint at an incomplete flat ΛCDM model or possibly unknown systematic errors in the measurements of the Hubble constant."</i>
